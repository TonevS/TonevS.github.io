                <h1>From Daphne:</h1>
                <h2>Hi Antani,</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the program. I have placed my feedback on your form below. You need this when you start your studies in September. But do not worry about it just yet.</p>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>Reading your motivation you seem to know exactly why you chose IT studies. Having experience in C# and SQL will help a lot in the program. What made you decide to come to Middelburg? And another in regards to a future job do you want to continue on in software engineering?
                </p>
                <h3>SWOT</h3>
                <p>You mention having some problems starting conversations. Most people do by the way. If you are able to find out why that is, it's also very easy to not have any problems with it at all.  Sometimes the adventure lies in finding out what you do have in common even if it seems very unlikely. Or just keep quiet until someone else starts talking (funny enough they always do...) So your strength must be being a very good listener? </p>
                <p>In regards to finding a Job, we have a company called The Work Zone. They help students find jobs and you will find their booth on August 31st in the grand hall of Campus!</p>
                <p>Looking forward to meeting you!<br>
                    Kind regards,<br>
                    Daphne</p>
