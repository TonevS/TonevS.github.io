            <h2>Info about me</h2>
            <p>My full name is Antani Tonev. You can pronounce my name like Anthuny. I am from Bulgaria and currently 19
                years old.</p>
            <p>In high school I studied extensively German and English. As for profiling subjects - Informatics and
                Mathematics. In Informatics I learned OOP in C# and queries in SQL and LINQ.
                I wanted to further my stuides and I think HZ is a great choice for me personally.

            <h2>What I do in my free time</h2>
            <p>
                I plan to find a part-time job to help with my finances.
                In my spare time I usually play games and browse through social media.
                While I cannot combine my part-time job with studying, I would make spare time by reducing my leisure
                time and use it for studying.
